Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I perform theoretical and computational research in the [Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab](https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/index.html) and the [Druckmann Lab](https://www.druckmannlab.com/). I am fortunate to be advised by Surya Ganguli and Shaul Druckmann. Prior to Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree from Fudan University.

Broadly, I am interested in understanding the mechanism underlying intellectual systems. I began my Ph.D. studying computational neuroscience, and have since expanded my focus to include artificial intelligence. Most recently, I have become deeply interested in advancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. I firmly believe that AI will play an increasingly central role in advancing the frontiers of mathematics and science.

I‚Äôm adventurous by nature. I enjoy rock climbing üßó, ice climbing, and mountaineering‚ÄîMatterhorn is my next big challenge.

I also recently picked up skiing ‚õ∑Ô∏è, so you might catch me in Tahoe this season!
